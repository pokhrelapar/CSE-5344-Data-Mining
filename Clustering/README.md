# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using KNN

This project explores a **binary wine quality dataset** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and builds a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier to predict wine quality. It includes performance evaluation through visualizations and stratified cross-validation.

## 📘 Project Description

- 📊 Perform EDA on wine quality data (null checks, class distributions)
- 📈 Visualize data trends (histograms, elbow curves, confusion matrices)
- 🧪 Train and evaluate a KNN classifier using:
  - Train/validation split
  - Elbow method to find optimal `k`
  - Confusion matrix visualizations
  - K-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation
- 📁 All graphs are saved locally as `.png` files
